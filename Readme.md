### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Client-Side Processing
- All credential processing happens in your browser
- No credentials are transmitted to external servers
- Network requests only go to cloud provider APIs

### Data Privacy
- No logging of credentials or scan results
- Optional localStorage for saving results locally
- Clear data when closing browser

### Network Security
- HTTPS required for cloud API calls
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Network connectivity warnings

### S3 Exclusion Notice
**S3 (Simple Storage Service) scanning has been intentionally excluded from this project due to:**

1. **Security Complexity**: S3 buckets can contain sensitive data and require specialized security scanning approaches
2. **Compliance Requirements**: S3 scanning may require specific compliance considerations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
3. **Data Privacy**: Automated scanning of S3 buckets could potentially access or expose sensitive customer data
4. **Legal Implications**: Scanning S3 buckets without proper authorization could have legal consequences
5. **Scope Management**: This project focuses on infrastructure enumeration rather than data scanning

**For S3 security assessment, consider using:**
- AWS Config for S3 compliance monitoring
- Manual security reviews and audits
- Dedicated S3 security scanners
- AWS S3 Security Best Practices

## 🚨 Error Handling

The application provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Invalid credentials** - Clear validation messages

## 🔒 Security Features

### Honeytoken/Canary Token Detection
PeekInTheCloud includes advanced honeytoken detection to protect users from accidentally triggering security alerts:

- **Real-time Detection**: Automatically detects known honeytoken/canary token accounts
- **Warning Modal**: Shows detailed warning before scanning canary tokens
- **Account ID Extraction**: Extracts AWS Account ID from Access Key ID for verification
- **Known Canary Lists**: Includes comprehensive lists of Thinkst Canary and off-brand canary accounts
- **User Choice**: Provides clear options to proceed or cancel (defaults to cancel)
- **Visual Warnings**: Red warning banner in results when canary tokens are scanned

**Supported Canary Services:**
- Thinkst Canary (canarytokens.org)
- Off-brand canary tokens
- Custom canary account detection

**How it works:**
1. When AWS credentials are entered, the system extracts the Account ID
2. Checks against known canary account lists
3. If detected, shows warning modal with details
4. User can choose to proceed or cancel
5. If proceeding, adds warning banner to results

This feature helps security researchers and penetration testers avoid accidentally triggering honeytoken alerts while testing discovered credentials.
